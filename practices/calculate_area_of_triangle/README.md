Triangle Area Calculation in Java
This Java application allows you to calculate the area of a triangle by inputting the lengths of its three sides. The process involves validating the triangle’s side lengths, ensuring they form a valid triangle, and then calculating the area using Heron’s formula.

Step 1: User Input Validation
The first step in the application is to gather the three side lengths of the triangle. This is done using the getSideLength function, which ensures that the user enters valid numerical values for each side. If the input is not a valid number (e.g., letters or symbols), the function will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid number.

Step 2: Validating the Triangle
Once the side lengths are provided, the application checks if they form a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. This is verified using the following mathematical inequalities:

𝑎
+
𝑏
>
𝑐
a+b>c
𝑎
+
𝑐
>
𝑏
a+c>b
𝑏
+
𝑐
>
𝑎
b+c>a
If any of these conditions are not met, the application will notify the user that the given sides do not form a valid triangle and ask for new input.

Step 3: Calculating the Area
If the triangle is valid, the area is then calculated using Heron's formula:

Area
=
𝑠
(
𝑠
−
𝑎
)
(
𝑠
−
𝑏
)
(
𝑠
−
𝑐
)
Area= 
s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)
​
 
where 
𝑠
s is the semi-perimeter, calculated as:

𝑠
=
𝑎
+
𝑏
+
𝑐
2
s= 
2
a+b+c
​
 
The result is then displayed to the user as the area of the triangle.

Step 4: Displaying the Result
Once the area is successfully calculated, it is displayed to the user with a message indicating the area of the triangle.
